However, Hercules was exiled from Olympus by Zeus as punishment for his unauthorized excursion to Earth. The Avengers housed Hercules as their guest for months, and he often assisted them in their adventures. He was eventually made an official member of the team, but he returned to Olympus with the Avengers to rescue the other Olympians from the vengeful Typhon. Afterward, Hercules elected to remain on Olympus with Zeus' blessing. Later, the Olympian god Ares hoped to incite war among Olympus and Asgard, and eventually Earth. Ares turned all the Olympian gods to crystal, and, as Hercules was unaffected by being only half-god, Ares' agents beat him severely and abandoned him on Earth. Hercules remained amnesiac for many weeks, until he was discovered by Hawkeye and returned to the Avengers. With the Avengers' aid, the plot was uncovered, and Ares was stopped. Hercules and his teammate, the Asgardian thunder-god Thor, sealed the access to both worlds. Hercules continued to occasionally interact with Earth, as was the case with his helping found the short-lived West Coast super-team called the Champions of Los Angeles after they had helped him and Venus thwart a plot by Pluto to force him into marriage with Hippolyta and invade Olympus.

One day, the villain Ocean-Master attacked Atlantis, causing Aquaman to battle with him. During the fight, Aquaman was defeated, but was suddenly helped by the combined forces of Kaldur'ahm and Garth. Using a combination of Garth's magic and Kaldur's fighting abilities, the two attacked Ocean-Master. Though they were easily defeated, this allowed Aquaman precious time to recover and defeat Ocean-Master. After the victory, Aquaman offered the boys the opportunity to become his protégés. Although Garth declined the offer and returned to his studies, Kaldur jumped at the chance to serve his king as his sidekick. He became a superhero two years before his tour of the Hall of Justice.

He is the son of the late Roy Harper, Sr. and an unnamed woman, the fiancé of Thea Queen, and the former sidekick/good friend of Oliver Queen. Growing up in the Glades, Roy became an ally to Oliver, who was a vigilante initially referred to as the Hood, later known as the Arrow. Prior to Slade Wilson's siege on Starling City, Roy was injected with the Mirakuru, becoming a human weapon and gaining a variety of powers, including superhuman strength, durability, and an accelerated healing factor, though it came at a cost with a slow deterioration of his mental state. He was later cured by Oliver using a counter-serum developed by S.T.A.R. Labs. Joining Team Arrow, Roy became Oliver's sidekick and vigilante partner using the codename Arsenal, also known as Speedy or the Red Arrow up until the point where Roy masqueraded as the Arrow and faked his death. Having no choice, Roy left Team Arrow and Star City to begin a new life under the alias Jason. Before leaving, Roy left his Arsenal suit to Thea, which she uses as her own vigilante persona as \\\"Speedy\\\". Roy would later return to vigilantism briefly when Noah Kuttler extorted him to steal technological components. However, he was freed from Noah's control and later relocated to another place. In 2018, Roy was found and captured by corrupt Star City Police Department officers under Ricardo Diaz's payroll, who wanted him to testify that Oliver was Green Arrow. He was rescued by Team Arrow and later left Star City along with Thea and Nyssa al Ghul in order to track down the world's remaining Lazarus Pits, returning to vigilantism once again. Ultimately, Roy's name (regarding his status as a vigilante) was cleared when Oliver publicly confessed to being Green Arrow. During Roy's mission, he was fatally injured in a battle against the Thanatos Guild and had to be healed in a Lazarus Pit. As a side effect of his previous exposure to the Mirakuru, he gained a bloodlust that couldn't be cured by the Lotus elixir. In an erased future, Roy self-exiled himself to Lian Yu to atone for the death of two innocent men he killed during a bloodlust episode. In 2040, he returned to Star City with William Clayton to assist the Canaries. On Earth-Prime, after the Crisis ended, Roy attended Oliver's funeral. He proposed to Thea and was ready to start a life with her, which she happily accepted on the condition he would never leave like he did again.\"\n",

However, under the leadership of his longtime teammate Cyclops, the X-Men turned to extremism, leading Beast to defect. His opposition escalated with the schism between Cyclops and Wolverine, for he joined the latter in building the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. The war between the Avengers and the X-Men consolidated Beast's allegiances, as he supported the Avengers and focused on opposing Cyclops' operations in any possible way. Additionally, he also assumed Professor Xavier's legacy in the shadowy organization known as the Illuminati. Mutantkind has been reunited by Professor Xavier on the mutant nation of Krakoa. Beast was a central part in planting the first seeds of the Krakoan civilization.

Hating the emotionless sea (and Aquaman, who he saw as its representative), the boy was determined to become its master.

The boy experienced being immersed in water as sublime ecstasy, while the softness of the cotton sheets of his bed bore for him excruciating pain. The attendants would strap him to the bed anyway, and to stifle his screams of pain, they would smother him with pillows until he passed out. The boy could barely speak, usually repeating a few words, such as \\\"love swim.\\\" The doctors began performing experimental treatments on the boy, experiments that seemed to cause him pain. One of these experiments was successful enough that he became able to speak in complete sentences. Using his newfound ability to seem normal, the boy put his doctor at ease enough to unstrap him. Afterward, the boy used the syringe used to help him speak to murder the doctor and escape. As an adult, he designed a costume (primarily a black wetsuit with bug-eyed helmet that was able to shoot blasting rays from its eyes) and fashioned a high-tech submersible inspired by black manta rays.

        "heroes_cleaned.loc[253, \"history_text\"] = \"Steve Rogers was born July 4, 1922, to poor Irish immigrant parents, Sarah and Joseph Rogers. Rogers grew up a frail youth during the Great Depression in New York City, New York. Little else is known about Rogers' early life other than the fact that a strong sense of duty, honor, and humility was instilled in him; perhaps due to his Irish Catholic upbringing. Rogers' father died when he was a child and his mother died from pneumonia later, when he was in his late teens. Steve used to go to a school in the Lower East Side neighborhood. Among the people responsible for instilling the patriotic values in him were his civics teacher Edna Crosley, who taught that as an American it was their responsibility to protect the United States which gave more rights than any other country in the world to its citizens. Horrified by newsreel footage of Nazis ransacking Europe and atrocities in Asia that the Empire of Japan committed in China and Korea, Rogers tried to enlist in the Army but was rejected as 4-F because of his frailty and sickness. Overhearing the boy's earnest plea to fight for his country, General Chester Phillips, of the US Army, offered Rogers the opportunity to take part in a top-secret performance-enhancing experiment called Operation Rebirth. Rogers agreed and was taken to a secret laboratory in Washington, D.C., where he was introduced to Doctor Abraham Erskine (code named Professor Joseph Reinstein), the creator of the Super-Soldier Serum. After weeks of tests, Rogers was at last administered the Super-Soldier Serum. Given part of the compound intravenously and another part orally, Rogers was then bombarded by vita-rays, a special combination of exotic (in 1941) wavelengths of radiation designed to accelerate and stabilize the serum's effect on his body. Steve Rogers emerged from the vita-ray chamber with a perfect human body. A Nazi spy, who observed the experiment, murdered Dr. Erskine mere minutes after its conclusion. Dr. Erskine died without fully committing the Super-Soldier formula to paper, leaving Rogers the sole beneficiary of his genius. Rogers was then put through an intensive physical and tactical training program that taught him gymnastics, hand-to-hand combat from Colonel Rex Applegate and William Essart Fairbairn, and military strategy. During the war, \\\"Cap\\\" served as both a symbol of freedom and America's most effective special operative. In addition to working with his young sidekick Bucky, Cap regularly fought alongside other Allied super-powered heroes such as Namor the Sub-Mariner and the android Human Torch, who were the recognized core of the World War II super-team known as the Invaders - a name suggested by English premier Winston Churchill. Rogers sometimes came into contact with a Canadian paratrooper named James Howlett, the man who would come to be legendarily known as Wolverine. During the final days of the war, presumably on or before April 18, 1945, Captain America and Bucky were trying to stop a bomb-loaded drone-plane, launched by Baron Zemo, when the plane exploded, apparently killing his partner Bucky and throwing Rogers into icy Arctic waters of the English Channel. The Super-Soldier Formula prevented crystallization of Rogers' bodily fluid, allowing him to enter a state of suspended animation. Although Rogers and Bucky had seemingly perished, the war still raged on and U.S. presidents and the government picked different volunteers, such as William Naslund, Jeffrey Mace, and another Steve Rogers, over the years, to keep the morale alive, and even after World War II ended. Decades later, Rogers' wartime comrade, the Sub-Mariner, stumbled across his still-frozen form, which was being worshiped by a far-flung Inuit tribe. Enraged, the Sub-Mariner threw the ice block into the ocean. While opposing Namor, the newly formed Avengers happened upon Rogers' thawing body and soon revived the legendary hero. Rogers joined their ranks as the first recruit, since their formation, and was given retroactive \\\"founding member\\\" status in place of Hulk. With his superhuman abilities, extensive training, combat experience, combined with his impressive physique, confidence, and will, Rogers was an excellent addition to the team. As a born leader, Rogers would come to be seen as the heart and soul of the team and his commands, while in the field, were often followed regardless of who might have been team leader at the time. Rogers would teach teamwork, tactics, and hand-to-hand combat to many Avengers over the coming years.\"\n",

The experiment involved testing the hull of a crashed alien ship's durability by exploding a super nuclear bomb under it while Adam was in the ship. Against the odds, Adam survived, the alien metal melding with his body, while the excess energy threw him forward in time nearly twenty years. Regaining coherence in 1986, Adam found himself a man out of his time and back in the hands of Eiling, now a general and the second husband of Adam's now-deceased wife. Everyone had assumed Adam had died during the experiment, so his presidential pardon was never issued and the current government refused to acknowledge the previous administration's promise. Seizing the opportunity at hand, the government used the outstanding murder/treason charges against Adam to blackmail him into being a government-controlled superhero codenamed Captain Atom.

        "heroes_cleaned.loc[822, \"history_text\"] = \"Eons ago, Lucifer Morningstar rebelled against the Kingdom of Heaven, and was cast into a shapeless void known as the Chaoplasm. The Chaoplasm was transformed into a desolate and barren expanse known by many as Hell, the final destination for damned souls. Here Morningstar ruled, awaiting the day he could be freed. Lucifer was forced to share his power after the Great Darkness's return. A Triumverate was formed, with Azazel and Beelzebub, but Lucifer retained the majority of power. At one point, Dream of the Endless entered Hell searching for the Helm that had been stolen from him when he was imprisoned. After Dream recovered his helm and slighted him, Morningstar threatened to destroy Dream. Lucifer eventually abandoned his lordship over Hell. Lucifer had ruled as lord of Hell for ten billion years. Over that time, he had manipulated the various demons of Hell against each other, provided a place for dead mortals to be tormented, and led the war against Heaven. However, at some point during his rule, he had become bored with this existence. He became tired of the various stereotypes that mortals held of the devil, such as the idea that he purchased and traded for souls, which were largely untrue. He also resented the assumption that he caused the evils that humans did- he did not, in fact, have anything to do with the actions of the mortals who ended up there, he simply punished them. He had become tired of his reign over Hell, and felt it an unfair punishment that he should have to rule there forever simply because he once rebelled. These feelings were catalyzed when he was visited by Dream. Lucifer expelled all demons and damned souls from Hell before locking Hell's gates and handing over the key to Hell to Dream of the Endless. Eventually, control of Hell was handed over to two Angels, Duma (the angel of silence) and Remiel (\\\"who stumbled rather than fell\\\"), while Lucifer simply retired to Earth, specifically to Perth, Western Australia. Now running a piano bar called \\\"Lux\\\" in Los Angeles with the assistance of his Lilim female consort, Mazikeen, Lucifer is portrayed as sophisticated and almost charming, similar to the stereotypical Christian devil. Beneath his charisma, however, Lucifer is a deadly and Machiavellian character, with no regard for human life or indeed any life other than those he can use to his advantage: a proud and vindictive fallen angel who has no qualms using powers second only to those of his father, Yahweh. In fact, Lucifer is described as having been the wisest, most beautiful and most powerful of all the angels in heaven, and he retains these traits even after his fall. Despite his egotistic and narcissistic tendencies, he does follow something akin to a code of honor- there are few beings in existence he respects (his brother Michael and the Angel Duma among them) and only two he could be argued to care about (Mazikeen, his consort, and his niece Elaine), though his actions on their behalf are almost always for his own benefit, and it is doubted by all that he would help them otherwise. He also refuses emphatically to lie (which he considers crass and undignified), insists on paying back debts, and keeps his word- though this must not be confused with virtue. Lucifer's \\\"restful\\\" retirement was disturbed by a series of associates from his past, and after various catalytic events, he endeavored to create a multiverse in competition with that of (and presumably against the wishes of) his father, Yahweh. This puts him on a collision course with several powerful mystical entities that have a vested interest in the new creation and draws the angelic host into the fray - including his brother, the archangel Michael Demiurgos and his niece Elaine.\"\n",

Soon, they came into contact with the greek heroes Heracles and Theseus, who befriended them. However, their alliance would not last, and the Amazons were betrayed by Heracles, Theseus, and their men. With their leaders leaving them to their spoils, their forces tormented the Amazons. One spear-wielding soldier in particular tormented Antiope a great deal; feeling her pain, Hippolyta cried out to the patron goddesses of the Amazons, and the Goddess Athena answered, on the condition that the Amazons would show mercy to those who had held them captive. At first, Hippolyta believed this feasible, but the spear-wielding soldier, so vile that even his own men would not stand by him, threatened Antiope's life if Hippolyta did not intervene. Throwing her spear at him, Hippolyta inadverdantly set off a chain of events that resulted in the deaths of all of Heracles' men.

Such was the Presence's nature that His aspects had names and identities of their own. At His direction, certain of these aspects were charged with certain functions and duties. Among them were His Wrath, called Eclipso, His Mercy, called the Radiant, and His Vengeance, called the Spectre. Three seconds after creation, there was a rebellion in Paradise. A rebel band of angels led by Lucifer Morningstar attempted to wrest control of Heaven from the Presence. As punishment, they were cast down into Hell, where they became the beings that mortal men knew as demons. In time, one of the demons, a creature called Aztar, came to repent his rebellion, seeking forgiveness from the Presence; legend in Hell has it that he was a prince among the damned. Aztar came before the gates of Heaven, where he was met by the archangel Michael. He prostrated himself before Michael, acknowledging his wrong-doing and his responsibility for what he had done, offering himself up to whatever punishment the Presence chose to impose. The Presence's judgment on Aztar was that he would become a vessel for an aspect of the Divine - the Divine Wrath. Aztar's memory and consciousness would be wiped from existence. Aztar accepted with regret, hoping that some fragment of what he once was would be allowed to remain. The Wrath of God entered into Aztar, burning away everything he had been, transfiguring the remnants of his form into the Spectre Force. Perhaps Aztar's wish was heard; millennia later, Jim Corrigan, the Spectre's then-host, saw a vision of Aztar's transformation, buried deep in the Spectre's core. This Primal-Spectre was the one who punished Cain for the murder of his brother Abel, laying a mark upon Cain lest any should kill him. For that, Cain sought revenge on the Spectre, and through him, on the Presence. When Eclipso fell to evil, it was the Primal-Spectre's duty to deliver punishment. The Primal-Spectre stripped Eclipso of his rank and privileges and tore him asunder, with Eclipso's power imprisoned in the black diamond known as the Heart of Darkness. It was the Primal-Spectre, the Spectre Force, that destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, that humbled the Pharaoh and killed the first-born of Egypt. The Divine Wrath was the blast that brought down the walls of Jericho and stopped the sun in its tracks. For centuries the Wrath of God punished and humbled mankind, until the birth of Jesus of Nazareth. At that instant, the Divine Wrath was cast into Limbo, for God's vengeance and forgiveness could not walk the same plane together. When Jesus died on the cross, the Divine Wrath was released from his exile and sought vengeance on mankind for the death of Christ. He was interrupted by the archangel Michael, who informed the Divine Wrath that due to the example of Christ, all aspects of God were now to be bound to human souls, as decreed by God himself. The Wrath resisted, his immense power was even able to greatly challenge the Archangel, but Michael would not be denied, and was able to force the Wrath to yield. He then sought out the soul of a person who thirsted for swift, vengeful justice. In India, a man called Chakara and his family were slain by the witch Lady Beltane. In the limbo between planes of reality, Chakara cried for justice. The archangel, Michael, appeared to him in the form of the goddess Kali. Michael asked Chakara if he would be willing to bargain his soul's rest for the chance to avenge his family's death. Chakara agreed, and his soul mixed with the essence of the Divine Wrath. Thus, Chakara became the first true Spectre, a killing ghost that sought justice and enlightenment. Chakara was unaware of the Spectre Force's true origin as a divine entity; he believed he was a human soul who had been granted divine power. Eventually Chakara would turn from his mission, seduced by a demon. As punishment, he was stripped of the Spectre Force and bound to the demon who had seduced him, becoming Azmodus, who swore revenge on all later Spectres. Over the centuries, there were many who joined with the Divine Wrath to become the Spectre, chosen from those who had met unjust deaths, and sought vengeance. Like Chakara before them, none of the Spectres were aware the Divine Wrath was a separate entity in its own right, believing that they had been granted the power to exact vengeance. None of these earlier Spectres operated in the public eye, and none gained world-wide recognition.\"\n",

In order to live up to his father's legacy he trained hard and knew that one day he would become one of the most powerful martial artists to leave K'un-Lun with the power of Iron Fist. However, there was one obstacle he had to overcome. He had to defeat the other person in line for the Iron Fist name: Wendell Rand-K'ai, son of Yu-Ti, August Personage in Jade and ruler of K'un-Lun. Davos proved unsuccessful in this attempt and was soundly beaten by Wendell. He refused to give up despite this beating but eventually Yu-Ti announced Wendell the winner which infuriated Davos who accused Yu-Ti of being biased towards his own son. Lei Kung told his son to stay silent and sent him away. Davos' pride and anger got the better of him and he went to challenge the dragon Shou-Lao in his cavern and gain the power of Iron Fist despite his loss. Shou-Lao scarred Davos over his left eye but Davos knew the secret to defeating the Dragon: to block the power of its heart with his body. However, the pain was too much and Davos soon succumbed to the Dragon's power. Lei Kung found his son defeated in the snow and took him back to the city. Yu-Ti then exiled Davos to Earth, stating that he could never return to K'un-Lun. Despite this, Wendell did not challenge Shou-Lao and also went to Earth. Tuan eventually died and Wendell's brother took his place and had a son named Daniel who would take the power of Iron Fist. It was here that Davos began plotting to kill Daniel and take the power of Iron Fist for himself.\"\n",

Ferrett and Bruno — thugs working for Nathan Ellery — barged into Alec's lab, knocked him out, and planted a bomb in the facility. Alec woke up just as the bomb exploded, and in flames, he ran into the swamp. His body had been drenched in the bio-restorative formula, and this affected the swamp's plant life, imbuing it with Alec's consciousness and memories. The newly conscious plant life formed a semblance of a human form and rose up from the bog as the Swamp Thing, the latest in a long line of Earth elementals created when The Green, the magical force representing all plant life, was in need of protection. The Swamp Thing laboured for a time under the misconception that he had actually been Alec, transformed into a monster. Eventually, he discovered that he was merely plant matter that had absorbed Alec's consciousness through a series of particular circumstances. Alec Holland, the scientist, really was dead. Alec's spirit was not at rest though, and he at one point appeared to the Swamp Thing. He urged the creature to retrieve his skeleton from the bottom of the bayou and give it a proper burial. This allowed Alec's spirit to free itself from the earthly plane and ascend into Heaven.\"\n",

Eventually, a trinity of beings called the Divine came to his planet, during their quest to eradicate the concept of evil, through an item known as the Heart of Darkness. The Divine then used the Heart of Darkness on Trigon and his guards. However, they were horrified when Trigon not only resisted, but consumed the Heart of Darkness, along with the collected evils of nearly one hundred galaxies, which heralded the true birth of Trigon. With his newfound power, Trigon killed the Divine, who he revealed were his parents, before shredding them of their flesh and wearing their skin. Now driven by insatiable hunger for evil, Trigon moved slowly from universe to universe, spreading his devastating brand of evil in order to sate a hunger that knows no end. He became the ruler of dozens of dark kingdoms across the multiverse. However, enslaving worlds eventually became tedious to him. Trigon began summoning women from other worlds to mate with and impregnate them, then send them back in an attempt to spread his evil across countless universes. Thousands of brides were brought to Trigon, however all of them wither died during conception or took their own lives after being impregnated, as they couldn't live with the thought of giving birth to Trigon's spawn. Eventually, Trigon is brought a human from Earth known as Arella, who gives him his first daughter; Raven. Shortly after her birth, Arella and Raven sought refuge in Azarath - a dimension dedicated to the notion of universal peace. This allowed Raven to elude Trigon for years, until Raven was eventually brought to him by the Phantom Stranger. At some point in time, Trigon claimed his place the hierarchy of Hell, ruling over his own pocket dimension within Hell, called the Underrealm of the Six Kingdoms of Trigon. Part of Trigon's underrealm is referred to as the Dark Dimension, by the All-Caste. This realm can be accessed behind the Great Door of Azarath.\"\n",

In order to incapacitate its inhabitants, she additionally folded the universe in half, merging every soul with another. This course of action accidentally resulted in the creation of Warp World, a pocket dimension where history was rewritten and adapted to the fused beings. Inside Warp World, X-23 and Scarlet Witch were merged together into Weapon Hex. Eighteen years prior in this world, the twenty-second attempt of the occult/scientific sect known as the Evolutionaries to create a vessel for the demonic Mephicthton had failed. Co-lead scientist Sarah Kinney posed the theory she and her lover Herbert Wyndham needed to stop trying to create a perfect specimen, but instead make something flawed. To this end, Sarah herself decided to conceive their next subject. Combining their best enchantments and enhancements, Sarah was impregnated and gave birth to a mutant girl, whom Sarah named Laura. Much to Herbert's chagrin, Sarah cared for Laura instead of treating her like an object. Sarah additionally nurtured Laura's humanity and empathy, whereas Wyndham tried to convince her that she was a weapon who had evolved past such values. The following years, Laura was trained in combat by Hellhound to become a perfect assassin, Weapon Hex. Wyndham often subjected Laura to a triggering spell that ignited a berserker rage-blindness within her. When Laura was older, Wyndham started sending her in missions accompanied by Hellhound. One of these missions consisted on fending off the Covenant from the keep. Another mission involved stealing the Storm Sigil from the Midnight Guns. Afraid that Laura could lose herself, Sarah created a younger clone of her, the speedster Gavrill, to anchor Laura to her humanity if necessary. Sarah kept Gavrill's existence a secret from everybody except her handmaid Bavel. When Laura was eighteen years old, Herbert decided to make the preparations for the ritual to have Laura contain Mephicthton. Fearing for Laura's safety, Sarah tried to escape with her. Wyndham used the triggering spell to mark Sarah, and had Laura kill her. After Laura snapped out of the spell, Sarah used her dying breath to forgive her, and revealed the existence of Gavrill, asking Laura to protect her. Weapon Hex rampaged through the Evolutionaries' Keep and found her sister's nursery. After meeting Gavrill, who preferred to go by \\\"Speed Weasel,\\\" Bavel tried to flee with them both, but were confronted by Wyndham and Hellhound. Weapon Hex ordered Speed Weasel to disrupt the preparations for the ritual while she confronted Hellhound. In the middle of the fight, Hellhound impaled Bavel and then dismembered Weapon Hex and left her for dead. Hellhound captured Speed Weasel and Wyndham began the ritual. Laura pulled herself back together and tried to stop the ritual. Weapon Hex killed Hellhound with a hex ray before Wyndham turned her to dust in return with a magical lightning. As Mephicthton began to possess Speed Weasel, Laura returned to life and used magic to summon the spirits of all that died as a result of Wyndham's plans. The ghouls mauled Wyndham to death while Laura severed Mephicthton's connection to Gavrill. The spirits disappeared, and Weapon Hex and Speed Weasel left the keep. Some time later, when the monstrous Devondra began to consume Warp World, countless scaled-down manifestations of Devondra started appearing all over the world. Weapon Hex was reached by Emma Frost's worldwide telepathic rally to fight Devondra's main form in the confines of Warp World. Following Gamora's defeat, Adam Warlock and his allies restored the universe to normalcy. However, they made it so Warp World continued existing within a facet of the Soul Gem, so the new life forms that resulted from its creation wouldn't cease to exist. Inside Warp World, some of the heroes that fought Devondra including Weapon Hex decided to remain banded together, and formed the Defenders.\"\n",

The program would ultimately wipe his memories, making his life all the more difficult. Despite his loner attitude, he would eventually join the X-Men, and even go on to reluctantly lead them.

Through this portal came the U-Foes, who had been trapped in another dimensional plane. Eventually, Charles escaped through another portal. While in absence, Charles accumulated various weaponry, and wound up having to kill (in self-defense) Kistur, a Mahari alien wearing Darkhawk armor.

After his parents were killed by a falling satellite, Guido settled with the owners for a considerable sum and moved in with his aunt and uncle until he reached adulthood. After losing much of his fortune, he began to take on jobs that would allow him to maintain his luxurious lifestyle. This led to Guido becoming the long-time roadie and bouncer for the mutant musician Lila Cheney. He was later among the mutants living on Muir Island who were mentally controlled by the telepath Shadow King. In order to satiate his bloodlust, the Shadow King encouraged arena fighting amongst the Muir Island personnel. Guido received a serious beating at the hands of Rogue. After the Shadow King was defeated, several of the Muir Island mutants, with the help of Valerie Cooper, were recruited into the new X-Factor team. His teammates included the former X-Men Havok and Polaris, as well as Wolfsbane and Quicksilver. At this time, Guido picked up the codename \\\"Strong Guy\\\" as a joke at an X-Factor press conference.\"\n",

She was an active hero and a good example for the people of the world. She actively served along with Superman and Batman in the Justice League. But, after Superman retired and the world became more violent, she, in turn, became more violent and bitter. As she lost her moral center, the Amazons decided that she had failed and stripped her of the role of ambassador. She was also stripped of her royal rank of Princess and exiled from Paradise Island. After this, she continued to work as an adventurer. She continued to visit Superman while he lived in seclusion in the Fortress of Solitude. It was Wonder Woman who brought Superman the news of the Kansas disaster and convinced him to return to the outside world. She was recruited by Superman for his 'Justice League' working as his second in command. She worked with Superman to rebuild the Justice League and oversaw many of the organization's operations in the field.

        "heroes_cleaned.loc[914, \"history_text\"] = \"Mongul's son, also named Mongul, was inspired to be just like his father. As a young child, he made journeys and he watched digital renderings where his father fought against Superman and his allies and the destruction of Coast City. He copied his father's actions when he encounters a group of marooned miniature aliens, turning them into his slaves. Once Mongul's father returned, and discovering his son's slaves, he kills the aliens and tells him only one being on the planet is worthy of adoration. Once he grew to adulthood, Mongul was forced to assist and train Superman in preparation for the arrival of Imperiex. He appeared to have been killed during the Imperiex War, but returned during the Infinite Crisis after learning from Despero that the Justice League had apparently been destroyed. His intention was to loot their Watchtower headquarters but he ended up fighting Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. During the fight he was almost killed by Wonder Woman before escaping via a working teleporter. The teleportation transported him to Earth, where he menaced Hal Jordan, the newly-returned Green Lantern, by using a Black Mercy plant on him and Green Arrow. He later sought his sister, Mongal, to settle family squabbles. The heroes broke free and used a teleporter to transport Mongul and Mongal to their home planet. Stating family to be a weakness, Mongul decapitated Mongal with a single punch to her head. In the aftermath of the Sinestro Corps War, Mongul received a Yellow Power Ring after breaking a dying Sinestro Corps member's neck. Soon after he tracked members of the Sinestro Corps, and offered the inductees a choice: to serve him or die. He removed the ring from each one who refused, and gained an extra five rings. Mongul's recruitment drive indirectly brought the attention of the Green Lantern Corps, in which he attacked Arisia and Sodam Yat with Black Mercy plants, and took them prisoner. He used his ring to send thousands of Black Mercy seeds, which he had genetically engineered to bring the victims' greatest fears to life, instead of their dreams, to several unsuspecting planets. In a confrontation with several members of the Green Lantern Corps, Mongul was defeated when the fly-like Lantern Bzzd flew through his eye, and he was thrown down to the Black Mercy's planet. There, he was buried in soil, being used as food by the Black Mercys. However, Mongul escaped this seemingly grotesque fate and made his way into outer space. En route to Sector 1114, he encountered two alien newlyweds, murdering one named Kered Riam. This incident inspired Kered's widow Miri to join the Star Sapphires. Following a brief rest from his injuries, Mongul went to Daxam and conquered the planet by himself in a matter of days. He then sent a signal to the rest of the Sinestro Corps, calling them to their new homeworld. Once a force of Sinestro Corps soldiers arrived, he announced that he was now their leader. Arkillo, the former drill sergeant and one of Sinestro's lieutenants, believed Mongul unworthy of leadership, and challenged him to single combat without their rings. Despite a fierce battle, Mongul ultimately triumphed, ripping out Arkillo's tongue, but sparing his life so that he would be \\\"seen but not heard\\\" by any who would dare challenge Mongul. In the process, he gains the loyalty of the faction of the Sinestro Corps loyal to Arkillo and complete rule over the planet Daxam, but draws on himself the attentions of Arisia and Sodam Yat, the Daxamite host for the Ion Entity. Mongul engaged into battle against Sodam Yat in which the latter used his Ion powers to briefly launch Mongul into space, before entering Daxam's sun and transforming it from red to yellow, granting all Daxamites superpowers. The Daxamites' overwhelming attack forces Mongul to have the Sinestro Corps abandon Daxam. Mongul relocated his base of operations to Korugar, where he similarly conquered and oppressed the planet's inhabitants, with the intent of making it a new Warworld. Soon after a freed Sinestro was brought to confront Mongul. Although Mongul outclassed Sinestro in terms of strength, Sinestro had designed the specifics for his Corps' power rings and were equipped with a failsafe program, and turned the battle against Mongul. After defeating Mongul and reinstating himself as leader of the Sinestro Corps, Sinestro cast him into the Sinestro Corps' central power battery.\"\n",

Known to few as the son of the Archfiend Belial and a mortal witch from Ur, he summoned his half-brother Etrigan to save Camelot from the evil forces of Morgaine le Fey. The attempt was in vain, and with Camelot's destruction, and the Demon's imprisonment within Jason Blood, Merlin went into hiding for centuries. Merlin did everything in his power to prevent the fall of Camelot, but could not fight destiny. Though his servant, Etrigan, fought the forces of Morgaine le Fey ferociously, Merlin called him to retreat. To stop the Eternity Book falling into the evil sorceress' hands, the wizard razed the castle himself, causing Morgaine's army to flee. Merlin decided to go into hiding, but could not allow his malevolent brother to roam unchecked. Merlin imprisoned Etrigan by binding him to a mortal soul with powerful magic, allowing himself to rest in suspended animation in a crypt secreted beneath Castle Branek until the world needed him once more. After centuries of searching, Morgaine le Fey managed to draw out the host to the demon who once served her greatest enemy. Sensing the danger posed by le Fey, Merlin sent an animated statue to Jason Blood's apartment requesting the demonologist to seek out Castle Branek so the Demon could be awakened once more. Merlin, however, only spoke to Etrigan telepathically, and appeared to Jason as an astral projection. It was not until the Iron Duke and his skilled witch, Ugly Meg, forced Merlin to show himself in person. With their defeat, Merlin returned to his plane of existence. Merlin continued his sleep cycle in his sanctuary beneath the ruins of Tintagel Castle. However, he was woken early by an unexpected visit from Jason Blood, demanding to be free of Etrigan. With regret, Merlin would not release his evil half-brother into the world, nor could he bear burdening another with the curse. What Merlin failed to foresee was Etrigan's grand scheme. Desperate, Jason played a specific musical scale to the sorcerer who became hypnotized by the sound. In a trance, Merlin followed the source outside where he came in contact with a hawthorn plant. In a cry of pain, Merlin vanished before Jason and Glenda's eyes. With Merlin banished, Etrigan was no longer under his control and the Demon escaped from Blood. Merlin found himself a prisoner in Hell, restrained and tortured amongst hawthorn needles by the Archduke Asteroth. The fiend mocked the old man by constantly showing him the past events that lead to his downfall as well as the current events of his unfolding scheme, while he slowly bleed the wizard and drank his blood, consuming his power. Asteroth lured Etrigan, Jason, Glenda, and Randu to Hell to use them all, along with Merlin, in a five-way blood sacrifice that would empower the ambitious Archduke with the strength needed to rule the Inferno. Before Asteroth could begin the ritual, Merlin focused the last of his power through a shard of the Philosopher's Stone. He combined it with Randu's ESP and channeled the power through all of the victims to Etrigan, who broke free of his bonds and defeated Asteroth. Etrigan fled with Jason, while Merlin transported Glenda and Randu to the safety of his sanctuary before sending them home to Gotham. After resting, Merlin attempted to find his brother, now loose in Hell, but without the aid of the Philosopher's Stone he resorted to seeking help from his father. Belial refused to help, nor would Lucifer or Beelzebub heed his warnings, but he soon sensed Jason Blood's mind reaching out to him and Merlin transported the mortal to his sanctuary, hypnotizing him into revealing Etrigan's plans. To buy time, Merlin brewed a potent stimulant that would keep Blood awake for days, containing the Demon, but Etrigan's will was too powerful and he smashed the concoction and forced his host to imbibe his mother's sleeping draught instead. Etrigan easily subdued the weakened warlock and left him bound in rock. Etrigan successfully deposed the Satanic Triumvirate and at his coronation, tortured the captive Merlin until he undid the spell that bound him to Jason Blood. Merlin gave in, or so Etrigan believed, but Merlin secretly communicated with Blood, forcing him to remember and take charge of his duty. Blood stole the Crown of Horns and recited the familiar spell to secure the bond once more, before Merlin transported Blood back home to Gotham with the Demon caged inside.\"\n",

        "**Some considerations:**\n",
        "* With little over 1,000 relevant data points, we have a small dataset. Combined with the high-dimensionality of our feature space with a vocabulary of 54,210 unique words, we are at a high risk of overfitting the data. It is therefore desirable to limit the vocabulary so that the classifiers will be able to learn patterns from the data and generalise better. We can, however, nevertheless expect particular trouble when we are going to use complex models, i.e. deep learning models.\n",
        "* The majority of data points contain less than 500 words. There are a lot of outliers from both labels with impressive counts going well over 10,000 words. It begs the question whether such large texts are useful for the models; do we end up just using electricity by incorporating such elongated epistels in our classifiers?\n",
        "* One way to reduce vocabulary size is through lemmatisation. However, for this particular task, it might be necessary to preserve some of the words to allow the classifiers to differentiate between the labels: the example of X-Men comes to mind, which, when token- and lemmatised, will be split in the words 'x' and 'man'. The plural form 'men' is typical for Marvel heroes, as DC Comics has, as far as I can recall, no collective of heroes containing the word 'men'. Moreover, the X-Men are highly central characters in the Marvel universe, to the point of having significance for peripheral hero characters, so by lemmatising it, we might lose an important anchor point for the classifier to differentiate upon.\n",
        "* To expand upon differentiating vocabulary, another challenge presents itself in the fact that both Marvel and DC creators work with the idea of a multiverse, meaning that both creators use 'Earth ##' to refer to a particular version of our planet in a particular universe. The recurrence of earth under both creators might confuse the algorithm."
